# Expression

A JavaScript library for multimedia programming at an introductory level.
Provides simple functions like `write`, `draw_rectangle`, and `add_note` for
creating text, pictures, and music. Features:

- Zero set-up required, as a new paragraph, picture, or audio track will be
  created when one is needed.
- The page may contain mixed media or even multiple contexts of each type.
- Simple functions focus on side effects to help new programmers learn about
  order-of-execution in imperative programming. The idea is to facilitate the
  teaching of functions and loops.
- Text is wrapped into paragraphs and may include simple headings and styles,
  which puts the focus on writing words as opposed to letters.
- Beautiful defaults ensure that even inexperienced artists can express
  themselves without too much risk of discord.
